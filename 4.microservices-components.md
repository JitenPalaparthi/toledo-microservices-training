# üß© Components of Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is made up of several key components that ensure scalability, autonomy, resilience, and operational efficiency. Below is a list of common components with examples.

---

## 1. **Service Discovery**

**Purpose**: Enables services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.

- üîç **Example Tools**: Netflix Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper, Kubernetes DNS
- üí° **Example**: `OrderService` queries `DiscoveryServer` to find the IP of `InventoryService`.

---

## 2. **API Gateway**

**Purpose**: Acts as a single entry point for client requests and routes them to appropriate services.

- üîÑ **Responsibilities**:
  - Request routing
  - Authentication & Authorization
  - Rate limiting
  - Load balancing

- üö™ **Example Tools**: Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, NGINX, Zuul

---

## 3. **Load Balancer**

**Purpose**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service to improve performance and reliability.

- ‚öñÔ∏è **Example Tools**: HAProxy, NGINX, AWS ELB, Istio

---

## 4. **Configuration Server**

**Purpose**: Externalizes service configurations and manages them centrally.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Example Tools**: Spring Cloud Config, Consul KV store
- üßæ **Benefit**: Avoids hard-coding config values like DB URLs or feature toggles.

---

## 5. **Centralized Logging**

**Purpose**: Aggregates logs from different services to aid in debugging and monitoring.

- üìú **Example Tools**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd, Graylog

---

## 6. **Monitoring & Metrics**

**Purpose**: Tracks performance, failures, and usage metrics across services.

- üìä **Example Tools**: Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, New Relic

---

## 7. **Tracing (Distributed Tracing)**

**Purpose**: Helps trace a request across multiple services and identify bottlenecks.

- üîç **Example Tools**: OpenTelemetry, Zipkin, Jaeger

---

## 8. **Containerization**

**Purpose**: Packages each microservice with its dependencies to ensure consistent environments.

- üì¶ **Example Tools**: Docker

---

## 9. **Container Orchestration**

**Purpose**: Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Example Tools**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad

---

## 10. **Message Broker (Asynchronous Communication)**

**Purpose**: Enables decoupled, event-driven communication between services.

- üì® **Example Tools**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, NATS

---

## 11. **CI/CD Pipeline**

**Purpose**: Automates build, test, and deployment processes for faster delivery.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Example Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD

---

## 12. **Security Gateway / Identity Provider**

**Purpose**: Provides centralized authentication and authorization.

- üîê **Example Tools**: Keycloak, OAuth2, Okta, Auth0
