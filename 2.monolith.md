# 🏗️ Monolithic Architecture: Advantages & Disadvantages

A **monolithic architecture** is a software design pattern in which all components of an application are combined into a single, unified codebase and deployed as one unit.

## ✅ Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

### 1. **Simplicity**
- Easier to develop, test, and deploy — everything is in one codebase.

### 2. **Performance**
- Internal method calls are faster than network-based communication between services.

### 3. **Easier Debugging**
- Tracing bugs is simpler because everything runs in a single process.

### 4. **Less Deployment Overhead**
- Only one deployment artifact (e.g., JAR/WAR file) to manage.

### 5. **Straightforward Testing**
- End-to-end testing can be done with a single integrated system.

### 6. **Reduced DevOps Complexity**
- No need for service discovery, API gateways, or orchestration tools.

## ❌ Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

### 1. **Lack of Scalability**
- You must scale the entire application even if only one part (e.g., user login) needs more resources.

### 2. **Tight Coupling**
- Components are often interdependent, making changes risky and error-prone.

### 3. **Slow Build and Deployment**
- A change in one module requires rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.

### 4. **Limited Technology Flexibility**
- You’re constrained to one language and tech stack across the whole app.

### 5. **Harder to Maintain in the Long Run**
- As the codebase grows, it becomes harder to understand and manage.

### 6. **Low Fault Isolation**
- A single bug can bring down the entire application.

| ✅ Performance           | Efficient internal communication                |
| ❌ Scalability           | Cannot scale components independently          |
| ❌ Maintainability       | Becomes harder with codebase growth            |
| ❌ Flexibility           | Limited language/tech freedom                  |
| ❌ Reliability           | One failure can affect the whole system        |
