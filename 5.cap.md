# ⚖️ CAP Theorem Explained with Examples

The **CAP Theorem** (also known as Brewer's Theorem) states that a **distributed database system** can provide **only two out of the following three guarantees** at any given time:

1. **C** – Consistency  
2. **A** – Availability  
3. **P** – Partition Tolerance

## 🧠 Definitions

### 🔹 Consistency (C)
Every read receives the most recent write (i.e., no stale data).

### 🔹 Availability (A)
Every request receives a (non-error) response — without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

### 🔹 Partition Tolerance (P)
The system continues to function despite arbitrary partitioning (network failures or message loss between nodes).

## 📊 CAP Combinations and Database Examples

### 1. **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**

> Prioritize consistency over availability.

- ✅ Always returns the most recent data  
- ❌ May reject requests during network partitions to preserve consistency

**📚 Example Databases**:
- HBase
- MongoDB (when configured for strong consistency)
- Redis (in Sentinel mode)
- Zookeeper

**📌 Use When**:
- Accuracy is critical (e.g., financial data, inventory systems)
- It's acceptable to sacrifice some availability

---

### 2. **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**

> Prioritize availability over consistency.

- ✅ Always returns a response  
- ❌ Might return stale or out-of-sync data during partitions

**📚 Example Databases**:
- Couchbase
- Cassandra
- DynamoDB
- Riak

**📌 Use When**:
- The system must always respond (e.g., shopping cart, social media feed)
- Eventual consistency is acceptable

---

### 3. **CA (Consistency + Availability)**

> Assumes no network partitions — **theoretically impossible in distributed systems**  
> Not suitable for modern cloud-scale applications.

**📚 Example**:
- Traditional RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) — when used on a single node or tightly coupled setup

**📌 Use When**:
- All components are in the same data center
- No need for distributed/partition-tolerant design

## 🚦 When to Use What?

| Scenario                          | Choose | Why                                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| Financial systems                 | CP     | Must avoid inconsistent data            |
| Social networks or feeds          | AP     | Users expect availability, tolerate lag |
| Local single-node applications    | CA     | Network partitions are irrelevant       |
| IoT or sensor data ingestion      | AP     | Fast write availability is crucial      |
| Distributed locks or coordination| CP     | Consistent state is critical            |

## 📝 Summary Table

| Type | Guarantees              | Sacrifices  | Example Databases     |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| CP   | Consistency, Partition Tolerance | Availability | MongoDB, HBase, Zookeeper |
| AP   | Availability, Partition Tolerance | Consistency | Cassandra, Couchbase, DynamoDB |
| CA   | Consistency, Availability | Partition Tolerance | MySQL (single-node), PostgreSQL |

## 🧭 Key Takeaway

> In distributed systems, **you must tolerate network partitions**, so you're always making a trade-off between **consistency** and **availability**.

Choose wisely based on your application’s **business needs**!
