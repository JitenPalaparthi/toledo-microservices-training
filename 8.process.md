# ‚öôÔ∏è Components of a Process in Operating System

A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. It contains various elements that allow it to function independently and interact with the system and resources.

üìù Explanation of Each Component

1. Process Control Block (PCB)

A data structure maintained by the OS to track process info.
	‚Ä¢	Process ID (PID): Unique identifier
	‚Ä¢	Process State: Ready, Running, Waiting, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Program Counter: Address of the next instruction
	‚Ä¢	Registers: CPU register content for context switching
	‚Ä¢	Memory Info: Page tables, memory limits
	‚Ä¢	I/O Info: File descriptors, devices used

‚∏ª

2. Text Segment (Executable Code)
	‚Ä¢	Contains the compiled program instructions.
	‚Ä¢	Read-only to prevent accidental modification.

‚∏ª

3. Stack
	‚Ä¢	Stores function calls, local variables, and return addresses.
	‚Ä¢	Grows and shrinks dynamically with nested calls.

‚∏ª

4. Heap
	‚Ä¢	Used for dynamic memory allocation (e.g., malloc, new).
	‚Ä¢	Size can change during execution.

‚∏ª

5. Data Segment
	‚Ä¢	Contains initialized global and static variables.
	‚Ä¢	Typically fixed in size once loaded.
