# ☁️ Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS

Cloud computing provides different service models to meet varying business and technical needs. These are:

- **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service  
- **PaaS** – Platform as a Service  
- **SaaS** – Software as a Service

## 🏗️ 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

**Definition**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

**You manage**:
- OS
- Middleware
- Runtime
- Applications

**Provider manages**:
- Virtual machines
- Storage
- Networking

**🧰 Examples**:
- Amazon EC2 (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
- Google Compute Engine
- DigitalOcean

**📌 Use When**:
- You need full control over your infrastructure.
- You're migrating legacy apps or building custom environments.

## 🧱 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

**Definition**: Provides a development platform with tools to build, test, and deploy apps.

**You manage**:
- Applications
- Data

**Provider manages**:
- OS
- Runtime
- Middleware
- Infrastructure

**🧰 Examples**:
- Google App Engine
- Heroku
- Azure App Services
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

**📌 Use When**:
- You want to focus on app development without managing servers.
- You need CI/CD, autoscaling, and dev tools integrated.

## 🧩 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)

**Definition**: Delivers ready-to-use applications over the internet.

**You manage**:
- Only your data and usage

**Provider manages everything**:
- Software updates
- Infrastructure
- Security

**🧰 Examples**:
- Gmail
- Google Docs
- Salesforce
- Zoom
- Dropbox

**📌 Use When**:
- You want to use an app without worrying about how it's built or hosted.
- You need rapid, scalable access for users.
