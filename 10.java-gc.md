# ‚ôªÔ∏è Java Garbage Collectors: Overview, Use Cases, and Trade-offs

Java provides several **Garbage Collector (GC)** algorithms to manage memory. Each has different performance characteristics and trade-offs based on application needs.

---

## üìå Why GC Matters

GC directly impacts:
- **Application responsiveness**
- **Throughput**
- **Pause times**
- **Memory footprint**

---

## üß† Types of Garbage Collectors in Java

### 1. Serial GC (`-XX:+UseSerialGC`)
- **Single-threaded** collector
- Best suited for **small heaps** and **single-core systems**

**‚úÖ Use Case**:
- Embedded systems
- Small CLI tools
- Batch jobs

**‚ùå Drawbacks**:
- Long pause times (stop-the-world)
- Not suitable for large or concurrent apps

---

### 2. Parallel GC (Throughput GC) `-XX:+UseParallelGC`
- **Multi-threaded stop-the-world**
- Focuses on **high throughput**

**‚úÖ Use Case**:
- CPU-intensive applications
- Background processing
- Long-running services

**‚ùå Drawbacks**:
- Longer pause times compared to CMS or G1
- Not ideal for low-latency apps

---

### 3. CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC` *(Deprecated in Java 14)*
- Concurrent GC with shorter pause times
- Aimed at **low-latency**

**‚úÖ Use Case**:
- Web servers
- Applications needing short GC pauses

**‚ùå Drawbacks**:
- Memory fragmentation
- High CPU usage
- Deprecated in favor of G1

---

### 4. G1 GC (Garbage-First) `-XX:+UseG1GC`
- **Region-based** GC
- Balances **throughput** and **latency**
- Default from Java 9+

**‚úÖ Use Case**:
- Large heap applications (2GB+)
- Applications needing predictable low-pause GC
- General-purpose production workloads

**‚ùå Drawbacks**:
- Complexity and tuning overhead
- Slightly lower throughput than Parallel GC

---

### 5. ZGC (`-XX:+UseZGC`)
- **Low-latency** GC for very large heaps (multi-TB)
- Pause times <10ms, **independent of heap size**

**‚úÖ Use Case**:
- Real-time systems
- Big data platforms
- Low-latency microservices

**‚ùå Drawbacks**:
- Available only in Java 11+
- Higher baseline memory overhead
- Not as mature as G1 (less tuning ecosystem)

---

### 6. Shenandoah GC (`-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`)
- Developed by Red Hat
- **Concurrent compaction**
- Pause times <10ms

**‚úÖ Use Case**:
- Low-pause applications on OpenJDK
- JVM-based trading systems, games

**‚ùå Drawbacks**:
- Slightly higher CPU usage
- Relatively newer

| Serial        | High       | Medium     | Small     | Simple apps, batch jobs       |
| Parallel      | Medium     | High       | Medium    | Background tasks, services    |
| CMS           | Low        | Medium     | Medium    | Latency-sensitive apps        |
| G1            | Low        | High       | Large     | General-purpose, web servers  |
| ZGC           | Ultra Low  | High       | Huge      | Low-l
