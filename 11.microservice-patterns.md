# üß† Microservice Design Patterns

Microservice design patterns help solve common challenges such as service coordination, fault tolerance, data consistency, and scalability in distributed systems.

---

## üß© 1. Decomposition Patterns

### 1.1 Decompose by Business Capability
- Break the application based on **business functions**.
- Each microservice owns a **distinct business area**.

### 1.2 Decompose by Subdomain
- Use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to split services by **bounded contexts**.

---

## üì° 2. Communication Patterns

### 2.1 Remote Procedure Invocation
- Synchronous HTTP or gRPC-based communication.
- Simple but can create **tight coupling**.

### 2.2 Messaging
- Asynchronous messaging using a broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **Loose coupling** and resilience.

### 2.3 API Gateway
- Single entry point that routes to internal services.
- Handles auth, throttling, caching, etc.

---

## üíæ 3. Data Management Patterns

### 3.1 Database per Service
- Each microservice owns and manages its own database.

### 3.2 Shared Database (anti-pattern)
- Shared DB between services creates **tight coupling**.
- Acceptable during early-stage or tight integrations.

### 3.3 Saga Pattern
- Manages distributed transactions using a sequence of **local transactions**.
- Types:
  - **Choreography** (event-driven)
  - **Orchestration** (central coordinator)

### 3.4 Event Sourcing
- Store system state changes as a series of events.

### 3.5 Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Separate models for **commands (write)** and **queries (read)**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Reliability Patterns

### 4.1 Circuit Breaker
- Prevents cascading failures when a service is down.
- Tools: Resilience4j, Hystrix (legacy)

### 4.2 Retry Pattern
- Retry failed operations with exponential backoff.

### 4.3 Timeout Pattern
- Set time limits to wait for a response to avoid blocking threads.

### 4.4 Bulkhead
- Isolate critical resources to prevent total failure.

---

## üîÑ 5. Deployment Patterns

### 5.1 Service Instance per Host
- One service instance per VM or container.

### 5.2 Multiple Service Instances per Host
- Host multiple services inside a single container (less common now).

### 5.3 Serverless Deployment
- Deploy microservices as functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).

---

## üîÄ 6. Observability Patterns

### 6.1 Log Aggregation
- Centralize logs using ELK, Fluentd, etc.

### 6.2 Distributed Tracing
- Trace requests across services. Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin.

### 6.3 Health Check
- Services expose health endpoints for monitoring.

### 6.4 Metrics Collection
- Export performance metrics (Prometheus + Grafana).

---

## üì¶ 7. UI Patterns

### 7.1 Backend for Frontend (BFF)
- Different APIs for different frontends (e.g., mobile vs web).

### 7.2 Client-Side Composition
- Each team delivers UI fragments to be assembled by the frontend.
