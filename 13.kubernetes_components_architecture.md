# Kubernetes Architecture and Components

## 1. Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## 2. Kubernetes Architecture

### Control Plane Components (Master Node)

| Component           | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **kube-apiserver** | Frontend of the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API. |
| **etcd**           | Consistent and highly-available key-value store used for storing all cluster data. |
| **kube-scheduler** | Assigns workloads (pods) to worker nodes based on resource availability. |
| **kube-controller-manager** | Runs controller processes to manage the state of the cluster (e.g., node controller, replication controller). |
| **cloud-controller-manager** | Manages cloud-specific control logic like load balancers, volumes, etc. |

---

### Node Components (Worker Node)

| Component           | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **kubelet**        | Agent running on each node. Ensures containers are running in a Pod. |
| **kube-proxy**     | Maintains network rules on nodes and handles traffic routing. |
| **Container Runtime** | Software used to run containers (e.g., containerd, Docker, CRI-O). |

---

## 3. Add-ons

| Add-on             | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| **CoreDNS**        | Cluster DNS for service discovery. |
| **Dashboard**      | Web UI for Kubernetes. |
| **Metrics Server** | Collects resource metrics from Kubelets. |
| **Ingress Controller** | Manages external access to services in a cluster, typically via HTTP. |

---

## 4. Communication Flow

- Users interact with the **API Server**.
- **Scheduler** and **Controller Manager** work based on API Server data.
- **etcd** stores cluster state.
- **kubelet** and **kube-proxy** run on each node and report to the control plane.

---

## 5. High Availability (HA)

- Multiple masters with load balancing and leader election.
- Etcd clustering.
- HAProxies or cloud load balancers.
